# Computational-Fluid-Dynamics # *Couette Flow* #Objective: #Solution of the partial differential equation for Couette Flow using the finite difference method. #A convergence criterion of 10^-6 was used. #Explicit Methods: #Forward Time Central Space (FTCS). #Implicit Methods: # Backward Time Central Space (BTCS) using Gauss-Seidel. # Backward Time Central Space (BTCS) using the Tridiagonal Matrix Algorithm. # Crank-Nicolson (CN) using the Tridiagonal Matrix Algorithm. # *Lid-Driven Cavity* #Development of C code for solving the 2D Navier-Stokes equations for the lid-driven cavity problem at two different Reynolds numbers, 100 and 400. #Discretization: #The problem was discretized using the finite difference method with specified boundary conditions on a 100Ã—100 grid.
